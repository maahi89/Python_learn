1. Difference between WHERE and HAVING
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| WHERE                                             | HAVING                             |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Filters rows **before grouping**                  | Filters records **after GROUP BY** |
| Cannot use aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, etc.) | Used with aggregate functions      |
| Used with SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE                  | Mostly used with GROUP BY          |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, DROP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| DELETE                 | TRUNCATE                      | DROP                                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Removes specific rows  | Removes all rows              | Deletes entire table                  |
| Can use WHERE          | No WHERE                      | Removes structure also                |
| Can rollback (usually) | Cannot rollback (in most DBs) | Cannot rollback                       |
| Slower                 | Faster                        | Deletes everything (data + structure) |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. What is Primary Key?
- Uniquely identifies each record in a table
- Cannot be NULL
- Cannot have duplicate values
- Only one primary key per table

4. What is Foreign Key?
- Creates a relationship between two tables
- Refers to a primary key in another table
- Maintains referential integrity

### Python ### 

1. What is class and object?
## Class :
- A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects.
- It defines the structure and behavior of objects by specifying:
  Attributes (variables)
  Methods (functions)
A class itself does not hold actual data — it only defines how objects should behave.

🔹 Key Points to Mention in Interview
  - Class is a user-defined data type.
  - It groups data and functions together.
  - It supports OOP principles.
  - Memory is not allocated until an object is created.

## Object:
  - An object is an instance of a class.
  - It represents a real-world entity and contains actual data.

When an object is created:
  - Memory is allocated.
  - Constructor runs.
  - Object gets its own copy of instance variables.
